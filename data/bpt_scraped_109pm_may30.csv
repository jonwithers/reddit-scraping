8,"That was one of the least rewarding shows I've ever watched, and I tapped out like 7-8 episodes in. The pacing is horrifically slow, the dialogue is so repetitive, half the characters speak in the most vague terms and can never answer a fucking straight question (I'm looking at you Tony, grown ass looking motherfucker... While we're at over half the cast couldn't pass for high schoolers). 

And above all: it was so depressing without anything entertaining to redeem it. I saw *Manchester By The Sea* (phenomenal movie) twice so I'm okay with heavy subject matter if it's compelling and not preachy and has a fun scene from time to time, but if there's never a break in the doom and gloom for even a moment then I can't sit through that. It was one of the most tedious, joyless things I've ever watched.

45,"Ok so I love drinking water I don't have to have flavoring in it just give me some ice and I'm good. But one time I was in high school I wasn't feeling well I thought I just had a cold. But it was lasting longer than a cold would and no matter how much water I drank I felt dehydrated. So my grandma took me to the hospital and I had to give a urine sample. I wrapped the cup in paper towels and gave it to the nurse and got back in the bed. 

And not even a half hour later the doctor came into the room questioning if I peed in the cup. And I told him I did and who I gave it to. But he didn't believe me so he kept asking me and I kept telling him I did. So he told me it looked like I took the cup and held it under the faucet that's how clear it was. And he hadn't ran any tests because he needed a actual sample I told him to try because at that point I didn't have to pee so he left.

Some time passed he came back and asked me how much water I drank on a regular basis. I told him and he told me to stop because I was drowning myself and I could harm myself. Then hooked me up to fluids because I was dehydrated I was so confused. In the end I had the flu and with how my immune system is set up .

Shout out to /u/TheBigFreezer for posting/reminding me of this MLK quote in the /r/nfl thread:

&gt; First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens Councillor or the Ku Klux Klanner but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says, ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically feels that he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time; and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.

715,"Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

Here's why:

Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.

Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say: ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!"" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?

Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

""Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1.""

And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

822,"For some reason there's countless trump supporters who still say ""proof that the president is racist?""

When provided proof:

""This is just hearsay, no evidence that he actually said that""

**Edit:**

Since many trump supporters are [sending me messages](https://i.imgur.com/ScEN7PA.png) about how this is actually about MS13, let me clarify that my point still stands regardless of this instance.Just because this quote was about ms13, does it mean that trump didn't say countless racist shits? It doesn't erase the countless times you ignored his racism


Also, why do t_d users always feel the need to make [new accounts just to send racist shit](https://i.imgur.com/R1Kja15.png), you're already anonymous, how much of a pussy are you?",1584,1526511650.0,This is America,3730
